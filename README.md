# myBook
Welcome

I use this as my own portfolio of what I have done, what I think of, what I'm grumpy on. Take it for what it is, this is my thoughts and I was to lazy to create a own blog or something like that, and then link to this. 

Map Structure:
 - thoughts . Uploaded as .txt files. Can also in some cases link to my own achivements.
