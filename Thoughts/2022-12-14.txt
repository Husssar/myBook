Okay, so for each IoT manufacturer that thinks their own protocol is
better than others. S T O P creating your own way. There are already
standards from different protocols that can be used.

Last day I looked at a company who made their own way of presenting
data. 
	
	0x01 | Temperature | 4 bytes | float.

Honestly, 32 bits for a temperature that is presented according to
documentation as 12,34. That's pretty typical IoT. One dedidated
developer, that maybe creating both Hardware and Software. But there
is no one for the person converned to think

All this shit is doing, is creating about 12397567651239767723781232
different message parsers, that each integration has to implement in
their own system. Is this really healthy? Do we really get speed from
this? Oh yes, some companies provide a parser "to get you started". 
So? It still just adds one more parser, for each integrator to work with
so now there is 12397567651239767723781233. 

My suggestion? Look into MBus, DLMS or whatever standard that already
exists. Follow it, and we can get digitalization and speed. And honestly
the best one I really like. OMS. https://oms-group.org/en/
